# Common Algorithms & Data Structures implemented in TypeScript

My goal is to implement common algorithms in an efficient and **readable** way. I always see them implemented efficiently but horribly in terms of separation of concerns, variable and functions naming, etc.
Please let me know your thoughts.

Unit testing done with Mocha & Chai.

```
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

Use this to run the unit tests. It also watches for any changes in the current directory and runs the tests when the files change. So feel free to hack the code and see if the tests pass right away.

Exit with `Ctrl+C`.
